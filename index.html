        <h2><strong> About Me </strong></h2>
        <p> Throughout my life, I have always loved solving problems. Would it be Jigsaw puzzles or a math equation, solving problems has always been my true passion. <br>
            with Web Development I get to struggle and find a solution to any problem that might arise which brings me tons of enjoymentment.  <!-- an about me section that includes my passion for web development and a oi describing my hobbies  -->
        </p>
        <p>Some things I learned in life and in my professional career are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Working together is always better than working alone</li>
        <li>Hard Work always pays off</li>
        </ul>
        <p> And whatever life brings my way I always fall back on those two things.
        <br>As I a kid I loved learning and building whatever I could get my hands on and with Code I can finally turn that dream into reality.</p>
        <p> At Thinkful I am very excited to start my coding journey but know that when I finish that my job has only start and I will continue to inspire to be a lifelong learner </p>
